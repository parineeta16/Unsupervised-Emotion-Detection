I have zero interest in moving the Republican National Convention to Doral in Miami, as falsely reported by the Fake News @nytimes in order to stir up trouble. Ballroom is not nearly big enough &amp; would like to stay in N.C., whose gov. doesnâ€™t even know if he can let people in? https://t.co/nqBBPv4VXS
