We are getting the Commercial Fishing Industry in Maine back on track (will be better than ever) after suffering years of stupidity and abuse from the previous administration. Already got 5000 square miles back and available to fish. China &amp; E.U. told to drop their Tariffs now!!! https://t.co/EcRxd2qWWW
